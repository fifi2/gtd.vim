==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*gtd-introduction*

Gtd.vim is a plugin to manage notes and keep them as reference files for a
future use. It comes with a major command |:Gtd| you would use to create new
notes or to retrieve already existing ones.

The goal is to save all your notes into a single directory and to rely on the
tags you used to retrieve next actions or former notes you may need again.
This way, you will take advantage of what is GTD and once you open a file that
is obviously needed at a time, you will get your notes right there, just
beyond the tags which allowed you to display the file.

Gtd.vim has been thought to let you decide what GTD workflow you prefer. I
give here examples of what you can do, not what you should. The objetive is to
present what this plugin can do.

Right after you set the directory in which to save the Gtd files (see
|g:gtd#dir|), you will create new notes in it with |:Gtd| command, named
accordingly to the current date and time to save time.
    Eg. 20170212_210000.gtd.

						*gtd-title*
To accelerate the creation of a task file, we create it with a filename
composed by the current date and time. To title it, you can use this syntax
"=Title" on the first line of the file. You will be able to find files with a
keyword in this title.

						*gtd-context*
The @ character precedes the context of the Gtd file. You can use one or more
context per file. It is dedicated to mark the files you want to retrieve in a
particular context.
    Eg. @home
	@work

						*gtd-action*
Gtd actions are some usefull tags to mark files in a distinctive state. It can
be used to create logical baskets for your tasks. Use what you prefer.
    Eg. !inbox
	!todo
	!waiting
	!someday
	!scheduled-20120712

						*gtd-hashtag*
You can add a bunch of hashtags to your Gtd files to mark they are related to
some peculiar concepts or people.
    Eg.	#john-doe
	#project-name
	#company-name

						*gtd-date*
The creation date of your notes will be known thanks to the automatic filename
of the files. You will be able to look for particular year, month and/or day
notes.

						*gtd-attached-files* *gtd-star*
Gtd.vim let you deal with attached files. It means you can automatically
create a directory next to your Gtd file to save some files into it. A special
marker [*] will be inserted at the end of the title to let you know attached
files are present. If you remove all the attached files of a Gtd file, the
marker will disappear.

						*gtd-content*
What is following your Gtd tags is the content of your Gtd file. The benefit
of this GTD system is that you've got your working notes below the Gtd tags
which let you know these notes are relevant at this particular moment. You can
operate search in the Gtd file content.

						*gtd-philosophy*
As I said, there are different ways to use GTD. The good one is what you
decide to do. Gtd.vim is designed to let you use any kind of action tags,
hashtags or contexts. It will just help you to search notes with the tags you
choosed. Here is just an example of what you can do with this plugin.

    1. New notes are tagged !inbox. It may be the main action tag. At this
       point, you need a title, a context, an action tag !inbox and the task
       detail right after in the file (if the title is not enough).

    2. You will regularly ask Gtd.vim to display !inbox files. While editing
       one of them, you can decide to change the action tag to something else:
	- !todo if you can deal with it now
	- !waiting if you can't do it right now
	- !someday if you don't want to do it now
	- !scheduled-YYYYMMDD if you would like to forget it until a
	  particular date.

       It is the right moment to add some hashtags, you may want to tag people
       involved, project name, technical concept or organizations related to
       the task.
        - #firstname-lastname
	- #project-name

    3. When you decide, you will be able to search for some notes and work on
       them, change the action tag, whatever.

						*gtd-sample-file*
Here is a sample of what a Gtd file may look like:

    =Title of the Gtd file
    @work
    !inbox
    #project-name
    #involded-person

    Content of the Gtd file, right after the first blank line.

    Etc.


==============================================================================
2. Configuration				*gtd-configuration*

Gtd.vim requires no external tools.

To enable loading the Gtd.vim plugin, you will have to activate plugin files
with `:filetype plugin on` in your Vimrc file. See |:filetype-plugin-on|

						*g:gtd#dir*
Directory where to save notes or to do the search. Default is the current
directory. If you want to save all your notes in the same directory (which is
important to perform relevant search), you may decide to set this variable to
a specific directory in your vimrc file. >
    let g:gtd#dir = '~/notes'
<
						*g:gtd#default_context*
When creating a new Gtd file, the plugin automatically try to insert basic Gtd
tags in it. If you want, you can define your default context to let the plugin
insert it as well. This default context will also be added in all your Gtd
searches as an "AND" argument. >
    let g:gtd#default_context = 'work'
<
						*g:gtd#default_action*
When creating a new Gtd file, the plugin automatically try to insert basic Gtd
tags in it. If you want, you can define your default action tag to let the
plugin insert it as well. >
    let g:gtd#default_action = 'inbox'
<
						*g:gtd#review*
You might want to have a quick review on your most frequent Gtd search. To do
so, you can populate the review list in your configuration. The review is done
when you execute |:GtdReview| command. >
    let g:gtd#review = [
	\ '(!inbox + !scheduled-'.strftime("%Y%m%d").') @work',
	\ '!todo @work',
	\ '!waiting @work',
	\ ]
<
						*g:gtd#folding*
Gtd.vim is able to fold your chapters on each title. See |gtd-syntax|. To
activate this, you have to let this setting. >
    let g:gtd#folding = 1
<
						*g:gtd#tag_lines_count*
You can let this to change the number of lines considered to search tags
(default is 20). You can let it to 0 if you prefer Gtd.vim loads all the file
and wait for the first empty line before leaving the search. >
    let g:gtd#tag_lines_count = 10
<

==============================================================================
3. Usage					*gtd-usage*

						*:GtdNew*
:GtdNew[!]	    Create a new task file.

		    Modifiers are allowed (see |<mods>|). Without modifier and
		    with the [!] any changes in the current buffer are
		    abandoned.

						*:GtdNewFromSelection*
:[range]GtdNewFromSelection[!]
		    Same as ":Gtd" except the selected range of text is
		    inserted in the new Gtd file.

						*:Gtd*
:Gtd[!] {formula}   This command allows you to search for some notes regarding
		    theirs tags or content. Results are loaded to the
		    |quickfix| list so you can navigate into it with the
		    |quickfix-window|.

		    {formula} is a string you can consider as a mathematic
		    expression.

		    - {formula} is either an |gtd-atom|
		    - And/or a group of atoms
		      Eg.   atom1 atom2	-> This is a AND operation
			    atom1 + atom2	-> This is a OR operation
			    atom1 (atom2 + atom3)	-> Factorization
			    atom1 (atom2 + (atom3 atom4 + atom5)) atom6
			    ...

		    Natural operator is AND but you can also choose to use +
		    operator if you need OR.
		    At start, the search is performed in all your Gtd files
		    but previous results (for AND operations) define where to
		    continue searching next operands.
		    OR operations allow you to concatenate results.

		    With [!] no default context will be added to the
		    {formula}. See |g:gtd#default_context|.

						*gtd-atom*
		    An atom is a part of your formula which can't be reduced.
		    Each atom of your formula will lead to a search in the
		    remaining possibilities.

		    An atom can be:
		    - part of a |gtd-title|. Eg: (=foo)
		    - |gtd-context|. Eg: @work
		    - |gtd-action|. Eg: !inbox or !waiting
		    - |gtd-attached| [*]
		    - |gtd-date|. Eg: Y2017, M02 or D12, respectively for
		      year, month and day.
		    - |gtd-content| to look for a |pattern| into your notes.
		      Eg: /bar
		    - |gtd-hashtag|. Eg. #meeting or #jean-marc

		    After the first character which is a leader allowing to
		    know what kind of atom you're looking for, atom can
		    contains |pattern| but no |/^| and no |/$| since they are
		    managed internally accordingly to their kind.

						*gtd-atom-exclusion*
		    You can exclude an atom of your results with -atom syntax.
			Eg. @context	    -@context
			    !action	    -!action
			    #hashtag	    -#hashtag
			    =title_search   -=title_search
			    /search	    -/search
			    Y2017	    -M12
			    [*]		    -[*]

						*gtd-completion*
		    Pressing <Tab> while you're editing your formula will
		    search for similar atoms in your existing notes and give
		    you back proposals. Date atoms are not supported in
		    completion system.

						*gtd-formula-examples*
>
		    :Gtd !inbox
<
		    Looks for the notes tagged !inbox

>
		    :Gtd -@work
<
		    Looks for notes related to any context but @work.

>
		    :Gtd !inbox @work
<
		    You can use several terms. What you get will match all the
		    terms (AND operator). This example looks for the notes
		    tagged !inbox and related to @work context.

>
		    :Gtd (!inbox + !scheduled-20170212) @home
<
		    Operators precedence is respected so you can look for both
		    !inbox notes and notes you wanted to get notice on
		    02/12/2017, all related to @home context.

>
		    :Gtd !todo #project
<
		    Looks for things to do about #project.

>
		    :Gtd =foo
<
		    Looks for notes with "foo" somewhere in the title line.

>
		    :Gtd Y2017 M02 D1[12]
		    :Gtd Y2017 M02 (D11 + D12)
<
		    Looks for notes created either the 11th or the 12th
		    February 2017.

>
		    :Gtd [*]
<
		    Looks for notes with attached files.

>
		    :Gtd /pattern
<
		    Looks for a pattern through your notes.


		    All of these can be mixed. So, if you want to look for
		    your notes:
			- archived
			- containing #john-doe or "john doe" somewhere in the
			  file
			- with context set to @work
			- and which are not about "foo"
		    You will use: >
		    :Gtd !archive (#john-doe + /john\sdoe) @work -/foo
<
						*:GtdContext*
:GtdContext {arg}   Change (or set) the current value of
		    |g:gtd#default_context|.

		    {arg} must be a valid context (Eg. @work).

						*:GtdAdd*
:GtdAdd[!] {formula}
		    Same as ":Gtd[!] {formula}" except previous results are
		    kept.

						*:GtdFilter*
:GtdFilter[!] {formula}
		    Same as ":Gtd[!] {formula}" except default working files
		    are deduced from the current |quickfix| list.

						*:GtdRefresh*
:GtdRefresh	    Refresh the current Gtd search in your location list.

						*:GtdReview*
:GtdReview	    If you are used to repeat a few |:Gtd| search, you might
		    like to use this command to execute them all in one
		    action.

		    See |g:gtd#review|.

						*:GtdFiles*
:GtdFiles	    Open the directory associated to your Gtd file and let you
		    put some files into it. During the process, the plugin
		    wait for you to press <Enter> before resuming its
		    operations. Once you've done, the |gtd-attached-files|
		    marker is inserted or removed to the title of the Gtd
		    file.

		    First time you will use this command on a Gtd file,
		    directory is created. Resuming it with an empty directory
		    leads to its deletion and to the |gtd-attached-files|
		    marker removing.

						*:GtdExplore*
:GtdExplore	    Open the directory associated to your Gtd file in a
		    vertical split. See |netrw| for details.


==============================================================================
4. Mappings					*gtd-mappings*

You might want to have a map to access your attached files in a quicker way
than executing |:GtdFiles|. To do so, simply associate the key combinaison of
your choice to <Plug>GtdAttachedFiles. This map is only available when the
current buffer has gtd filetype. >
    nmap <Leader>tf <Plug>GtdAttachedFiles
<
You can set a map to create a new Gtd file in a quicker way than using
|:GtdNew| or |:GtdNewFromSelection|. Key combinaisons can be equal. >
    nmap <Leader>tn <Plug>GtdNew
    vmap <Leader>tn <Plug>GtdNew
<
Other optional mapping have to be written manually in your vimrc file.
Eg. To quickly search for pending tasks or scheduled today: >
    nnoremap <Leader>tw :Gtd @work (!inbox + !scheduled-<C-R>=strftime("%Y%m%d")<CR>)<CR>
<
